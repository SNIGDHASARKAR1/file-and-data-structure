        "1. What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
        "  -   Data structures are essentially ways of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. They serve as the backbone for various algorithms and software applications.\n",
        "  Data structures are important for the following reasons:\n",
        "  i. Efficiency\n",
        "  ii. Data management\n",
        "  iii. Resource optimization\n",
        "  iv. Scalability\n",
        "  v. Reusability\n",
        "  vi. Complex problem solving\n",
        "  vii. Data integrity and security\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Mutable data types can be changed after they are created. Eg- lists, dictionaries and sets.\n",
        "     Immutable data types cannot be changed after they are created. Eg- Strings and tuples.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  i. Lists are mutable while tuples are immutable.\n",
        "     ii. Tuples are more memory efficient than lists.\n",
        "     iii. Tuples are faster than list.\n",
        "     iv. List have more built in methods than tuples.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique and is used to access the corresponding value. Dictionaries are mutable, meaning we can change their content without changing their identity.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Set is used instead of a list in Python as sets are highly useful to efficiently remove duplicate values from a collection like a list and to perform common math operations like unions & intersections.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed within single quotes ('...'), double quotes (\"...\"), or triple quotes ('''...''' or \"\"\"...\"\"\"). Strings are used to represent text-based data.\n",
        "     A list is an ordered collection of elements that can store different data types, such as integers, strings, and even other lists. Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify them after creation by adding, removing, or changing elements. Lists are created using square brackets [] or the list() function.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.   How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Tuples ensure data integrity in Python in a few key ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "        1. Immutability\n",
        "        2.Predictable hash values\n",
        "        3. Consistency in function returns\n",
        "        4.Avoids accidental changes\n",
        "        5. Explicit structure\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  A hash table is a data structure that allows you to store and retrieve data using a technique called hashing. Hashing involves using a hash function to convert a key into an index in an array. This index is where the corresponding value is stored, making data retrieval very efficient.\n",
        "   In python, dictionaries are used to implement hash tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Yes, alist can also contain a mix of Python types including Strings, floats and boolean.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Strings are made immutable in Python which avoids unnecessary bugs.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.  What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Dictionaries use a hash table to store key value pairs, which allows for very fast lookups. This makes dictionaries ideal for tasks that require frequent lookups or searches.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Tuples are preferred over lists in the following cases:\n",
        "\n",
        "     i.When we want to ensure that data is not changed accidentally. Tuples\n",
        "       being immutable do not allow any changes in its data.\n",
        "     ii.When we want faster access to data that will not change as tuples are\n",
        "       faster than lists.\n",
        "     iii.When we want to use the data as a key in a dictionary.\n",
        "      iv.When we want to use the data as an element of a set.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  In Python, sets are collections of unique elements. This means that sets automatically handle duplicate values by ensuring that each element appears only once.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  When used with lists, the in keyword checks if a given element is present in the list. It sequentially searches through the list elements to find a match.\n",
        "     When used with dictionaries, the in keyword checks if a given key exists in the dictionary. It does not check for values.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.  Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  No, we cannot modify the elements of a tuple in Python. Tuples are immutable, which means once they are created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -  A nested dictionary is a dictionary within another dictionary. This allows you to store and organize data in a hierarchical manner, making it easy to group related information together.\n",
        "  EG: Imagine you want to store information about students and their grades in different subjects. A nested dictionary can be used to achieve this.\n",
        "\n",
        "   \n",

        "17.  Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "     -   Accessing elements in a Python dictionary is highly efficient due to the underlying implementation of hash tables. Let's break down the time complexity:\n",
        "\n",
        "     Average Case:\n",
        "     Time Complexity: O(1)\n",
        "\n",
        "     Reason: In the average case, accessing an element by its key involves computing the hash value of the key, which directs you to the exact location in the hash table where the value is stored. This direct access results in constant time complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Worst Case:\n",
        "     Time Complexity: O(n)\n",
        "\n",
        "     Reason: In the worst case, all keys hash to the same index, leading to collisions. Python handles collisions using a technique called \"open addressing,\" where it searches for the next available slot. If all keys end up in the same slot, it might need to search through all elements, resulting in linear time complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.    In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -  Situations Where Lists are Preferred:\n",
        "       Ordered Data:\n",
        "\n",
        "        When you need to maintain the order of elements, lists are preferred because they preserve the order of insertion.\n",
        "\n",
        "       Sequential Access:\n",
        "\n",
        "       If you need to iterate over elements in sequence, lists provide efficient sequential access.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.   Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data\n",
        "      retrieval?\n",
        "\n",
        "      -  Dictionaries in Python are considered unordered because they don't maintain any particular order for the elements you add. This characteristic stems from their implementation using hash tables.\n",
        "      Impact on Data Retrieval:\n",
        "        1.No Guaranteed Order\n",
        "        2.Efficient Lookups\n",
